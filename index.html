            <h2>African Daisy</h2>
            <p class="show-text"></p>
            <p class="card-text">This is an excellent choice for anyone looking for bright, beautiful blooms all through summer into fall. There are around 70 species of Osteospermum and an increasing number of cultivars, and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) lists about 900 varieties. One stem carries a single flower, comprising a central disc surrounded by bright petals. The petals of some species are variegated in color, offering the most stunning bloom. Most petals are flat, but some produce spoon-shaped petals, such as the Osteospermum Sunny Philip. Depending on what zone you live in, different species can be annuals or perennials. </p>

            <h2>Seven-spot ladybird</h2>
            <p class="show-text"></p>
            <p class="card-text">he seven-spot (or 7-spot) ladybird reaches five to eight millimetres in length and, like all insects, has six legs. As the name suggests, it has seven black spots on its orange-red wing cases. The seventh dot, which is separated by the two wings and flanked by two bright, elongated spots, is a special identifying feature of Coccinella septempunctata. There are also two white spots on the front part of the chest, as well as on the head between the two black eyes. The seven-spot ladybird has two antennae with which it can “smell” and feel. Unlike other ladybird species, seven-spot ladybirds all look more or less the same – it is rare for members of this species to deviate in terms of wing case colour or how many spots they have.</p>
